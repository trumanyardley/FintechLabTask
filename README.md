**Tech Stack**
================

* **Python** (for data analysis, visualization, and backend logic)
* **HTML** (for frontend markup and structuring content)
* **CSS** (for styling and layout)
* **Matplotlib** and **Pandas** (for data visualization and analysis)
* **Flask** (for building the web application)
* **Anthropic Claude 3 LLM** (for generating insights)
* **SEC-API** (for gathering data to create visualizations)

**Project Overview**
=====================

This project leverages a combination of technologies to generate insights and visualizations from 10K data. **Python** was the primary language used, due to its extensive libraries and ease of use. **HTML** and **CSS** were employed for web app design, while **Flask** was utilized for backend development. **Anthropic Claude 3 LLM** was chosen for insight generation, thanks to its large token acceptance and current status as one of the best LLMs available. **SEC-API** was used for data gathering, as its library made it easy to create visualizations.

**Insights and Visualizations**
==============================

The insights generated by **Claude 3** provide a summary and outline of the risks the company was exposed to, as well as general management information for the given year. These insights are useful because they offer an accurate outline within a larger context. Additionally, they can be cross-referenced with generated revenue visualizations for that year, allowing for a comprehensive understanding.

**Deployment**
==============

Due to limited credits for **Anthropic's Claude**, the app was not deployed to a hosting service. However, a demo recording is included below.
